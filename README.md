## What it is about and key finding 

This bachelor thesis investigates the influence of feedback specificity provided by Language Learning Models (LLMs) on the creativity and quality of human creative outputs. The study was motivated by the increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in creative fields and aimed to determine how variations in AI-driven feedback affect creative processes.

Through a series of experiments, the thesis explored the effects of specific, generic, and absent feedback modalities on creative tasks. Utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques, including semantic similarity and sentiment analyses, the study quantitatively assessed the impact of these feedback types on the originality and quality of creative works produced by participants.

The key finding of this research is that specific, detailed feedback significantly enhances the creativity and quality of creative outputs compared to more general feedback or no feedback. This effect was most pronounced in tasks that required high levels of originality, such as story continuation. Specific feedback was found to lead to greater semantic alignment with creative benchmarks, fostering deeper engagement and higher quality in creative tasks.

The implications of these results are substantial for the application of AI in creative contexts, suggesting that AI-driven feedback systems should be designed to provide tailored, context-specific feedback to effectively enhance creative outcomes. This study not only contributes to the academic discourse on AI and creativity but also provides actionable insights for developers and educators looking to harness AI tools to foster creativity in educational and professional settings.
