Ebenfalls schickte ich zur Beschützung der Mannschaft eine Schar von Schutzdelfinen, die sich durch ihre hohe Wachsamkeit und Kampfesstärke auszeichneten. Als die Mannschaft sich dem UFO näherte, stieg die Spannung weiter an. Von außen betrachtet gab es weder eine Eingangstür noch einen sonstigen Öffnungsmechanismus. Plötzlich tippte einer der Delphine mit seiner Schnauze an eine Stelle der stählernen Haut des UFOs, und plötzlich verschoben sich die Stahlplatten zu einem Eingang. Beim Betreten des UFOs glaubte kurze Zeit später die Mannschaft ihren Augen nicht: das gesamte UFO war voll von kleinen Gestalten, die emsig herumeilten. Dabei schienen sie keiner bestimmten Ordnung zu folgen, trotzdem machte es einen durchaus systematischen Eindruck. Die kleinen Männchen sahen grundsätzlich fröhlich oder zumindest neugierig aus und verstrahlen keinerlei Feindseligkeit.

After what seemed like an eternity, we arrived on a very, very, very distant island. On this island there was a big golden crab who asked me: Where are you going? And I answered him: I am crossing the seas in search of adventure, but I have no final destination. The crab laughed and mockingly said to me: It's probably because your heart still has a shell that needs to be broken and you need to dig deep into yourself to find out what moves you and what you want. After we spoke, he handed me a map and said, This is the map of truth, it will take you where you need to go, then he gave me a giant sugar stick and a lizard to go with me.

A crew member had discovered a glow of light in the depths of the sea that may have belonged to a sunken UFO that tried to land on Earth many thousands of years ago and has since been considered lost. The magical ship had been scouring the seas for many moons in search of this UFO. The captain immediately decided to assign a crew to board the UFO. I also sent a flock of protective dolphins to protect the crew, which were characterized by their high level of vigilance and fighting strength. As the crew approached the UFO, the tension continued to rise. From the outside, there was neither an entrance door nor any other opening mechanism. Suddenly, one of the dolphins tapped its snout against a spot on the UFO's steel skin, and suddenly the steel plates shifted to form an entrance. When the crew entered the UFO a short time later, they could not believe their eyes: the entire UFO was full of small creatures bustling about. They didn't seem to follow any particular order, but it still made a very systematic impression. The little men generally looked cheerful or at least curious and did not radiate any hostility. This made the sudden attack on a crew member all the more unexpected: within milliseconds, he was bound by thin ropes and completely immobilized.\",\n",
